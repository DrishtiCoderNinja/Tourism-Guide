Tourism is for travel and pleasure; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating,<br>
 and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.[1] Tourism may be international, or within the traveler's country.<br>
 The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception<br>
 of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only ", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside <br>
their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".<br>
 Tourism is the act of travel for predominantly recreational or leisure purposes, and also refers to the <br>
provision of services in support of this act. According to the World Tourism Organization, tourists are<br>
 people who "travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure,<br>
 business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited<br>
