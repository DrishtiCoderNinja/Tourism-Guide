 The north Indian town of Dharamshala (also spelled ‘Dharamsala’, ‘Dharmshala’ and occasionally ‘Dharmsala’) is a true ‘global village’.
 Perched on a spur of the Dhauladhar range in the foothills of the Himalayas, this bustling town of 35,000 people is a bridge between worlds.
The heart of the Tibetan community of Dharamshala is the settlement of McLeodGanj,
 which runs along a ridge overlooking the town of Dharamshala proper. </FONT>
