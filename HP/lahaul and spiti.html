The district of Lahaul-Spiti in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh consists of the two formerly separate districts of Lahaul and Spiti.
 The present administrative centre is Keylong in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged,
 Kardang was the capital of Lahaul, and Dhankar the capital of Spiti.
 The district was formed in 1960.
Kunzum la or the Kunzum Pass (altitude 4,551 m; 14,931 ft) is the entrance pass to the Spiti Valley from Lahaul. It is 21 km from Chandra Tal.
 This district is connected to Manali through the Rohtang Pass.
 To the south, Spiti ends 24 km from Tabo, at the Sumdo where the road enters Kinnaur and joins with National Highway No.
