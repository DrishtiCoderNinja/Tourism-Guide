Palampur is a fascinating spot in the Kangra Valley, surrounded on all sides by tea gardens and pine forests.
 The place enjoys a healthy climate and the pine scented air is said to have curative properties. 
The scenery presents a sublime and beautiful contrast- the plain presents a picture of rural loveliness and repose, while the hills are majestic.
 Behind this town stands high ranges of Dhauladhar mountains, whose tops remain covered for most part of the year.
 This place is being developed as large tourist centre. </FONT>
